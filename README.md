Haskell Implementation of Tic Tac Toe Using GI-GTK
We are exploring a Haskell implementation of the popular game Tic Tac Toe with a UI to see if making front end applications using Haskell would be easier or harder compared to other front-end solutions. A player vs computer mode is implemented, as well as a GUI for the game that opens in a new window when you run the program. The window has 9 empty squares for players to click and there will be a display box at the top of the window that will display various feedback messages depending on the current state of the game. We wanted to see if building a UI could be done functionally and feel natural in Haskell.
